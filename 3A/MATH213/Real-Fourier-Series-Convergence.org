* Real Fourier Series
** Periodic Functions
A function $f$ defined on $\mathbb{R}$ is $\tau$ *periodic* if for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$
$$
f(t) = f(t + \tau)
$$
Generally pick the smallest value of $\tau$ such that the above holds.

The theorem for Fourier Coefficients for Series in Complex Form holds for $\tau$ periodic
functions, and can integrate over 1 period.

When finding the Fourier series without knowing the domain for $f$ and knowing that $f$ is $\tau$
periodic, first find the $\tau$ period of $f$ and do the computation over a period of $f$.

** Fourier Sinusoidal Series
A function $f$ is *even* if $f(-t) = f(t)$.
A function $f$ is *odd* if $f(-t) = -f(t)$.

For a real valued $\tau$ periodic function $f \in L^{2}([-\tau/2,\tau/2])$:
- if $f$ is even, then the Fourier series can be simplified to a sum of cosine waves: Fourier
  cosine series
- if $f$ is odd, then the Fourier series can be simplified to a sum of sine waves: Fourier
  sine series

If $f$ is a real valued function that is in $L^{2}([-\tau/2,\tau/2])$, then
- if $f$ is even, then the Fourier cosine series for $f$ is
  $$
  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n} \cos\left( \frac{2\pi n}{\tau} t \right)
  $$
  where
  $$
  c_{n} = \begin{cases}
        \left< f(t), 1 \right> & n = 0 \\
        2\left< f(t), \cos \left( \frac{2\pi n}{\tau} t \right) \right> & n > 0
  \end{cases}
  $$
- if $f$ is odd, then the Fourier sine series for $f$ is
  $$
  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}s_{n} \sin\left( \frac{2\pi n}{\tau} t \right)
  $$
  where
  $$
  s_{n} = 2\left< f(t), \sin \left( \frac{2\pi n}{\tau} t \right) \right>
  $$

If $f$ is real, then it can be decomposed into even and odd functions as follows:
$$
f_{even}(t) = \frac{f(t) + f(-t)}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad
f_{odd}(t) = \frac{f(t) - f(-t)}{2}
$$
with $f(t) = f_{even}(t) + f_{odd}(t)$.

Every real valued function in $L^{2}([-\tau/2,\tau/2])$ admits a real valued Fourier series
with some sin and/or cos terms.

* Convergence of Fourier Series
** Types of Convergence
If $f_{1}, f_{2}, \dots, f_{n}, \dots$ is a sequence of $L^{2}$ functions defined on $[a,b]$,
then:
- the sequence *converges in the $L^{2}([a,b])$ norm*, or *converges in the mean*, or
  *converges almost everywhere*, to $f$ if
  $$
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt{\int_{a}^{b} |f_{n}(x) - f(x)|^{2} \, dx} = 0
  $$
  which is when the average error goes to 0
- the sequence *pointwise converges* to $f$ if for any $x \in [a,b]$
  $$
  \lim_{n \to \infty} (f_{n}(x) - f(x)) = 0
  $$
  which is when the error at each point goes to 0
- the sequence *uniformly converges* to $f$ if
  $$
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \max_{[a,b]} |f_{n}(x) - f(x)| = 0
  $$
  which is when the maximum error converges to 0
  - if the maximum does not exist, then replace it with the smallest upper bound (called
    the sup)

** Fourier Series Convergence
A function $f$ is *Piecewise $C^{1}$* (PWC1) on the interval $[a,b]$ if there is a finite
partition $a = t_{0} < t_{1} < \cdots < t_{k} = b$ such that:
- $f'$ exists on each interval $(t_{i}, t_{i+1})$
- $f'$ is continuous on each interval $(t_{i}, t_{i+1})$
- $f$ and $f'$ are bounded on each interval $(t_{i}, t_{i+1})$

The *periodic extension* of a function $f$ defined on $[a,b]$ is the $b-a$ periodic
function $f_{p}$ such that
- $f_{p}(t) = f(t)$ for $t \in (a,b)$ where $f(t)$ is continuous
- $f_{p}(t) = \frac{f(t^{-}) + f(t^{+})}{2}$ for $t \in (a,b)$ where $f(t)$ is not continuous
- $f_{p}(a) = \frac{f(a) + f(b)}{2} = f_{p}(b)$

Let $f_{p}$ be the periodic extension of a function $f \in L^{2}([-\tau/2, \tau/2])$:
- the Fourier series of $f$ converges in the $L^{2}$ norm to $f$ and $f_{p}$ on any finite
  subinterval of $[-\tau/2, \tau/2]$
- if $f_{p}$ is piecewise $C^{1}$, then the Fourier series of $f$ converges pointwise to
  $f_{p}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$
- if $f_{p}$ is piecewise $C^{1}$ and continuous, then the Fourier series of $f$ converges
  uniformly to $f_{p}$ on any finite interval of $\mathbb{R}$

*Gibbs Phenomenon*: for an $L^{2}([a,b])$ function $f$ with periodic extension $f_{p}$,
if $f_{p}$ is not continuous at some point $t_{0}$, then _truncated_ Fourier series of
$f$ will have growing oscillations near the point $t_{0}$
- these oscillations do not appear in the infinite sum
