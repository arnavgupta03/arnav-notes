* Transformable Shapes
Direct manipulation widgets to transform an object:
- scale by dragging corner and side handles
- rotate by dragging rotation handle
- translate by dragging shape

For translation:
- if mousedown inside rectangle, save mouse position
- on mousemove, calculate a drag delta, which is used for a shape position delta
- use shape position delta to draw shape
- on mouseup, commit shape delta to shape position, then clear shape delta

For scale:
- if mousedown inside circle, save mouse position
- on mousemove, use drag delta for a shape size delta
- use shape size delta to draw shape
- on mouseup, commit shape delta to shape size, then clear shape delta

For rotate:
- if mousedown inside circle, save mouse position
- on mousemove, use mouse position to calculate a shape angle delta
- use delta to draw shape
  - draw shape centered at 0,0
  - subtract shape x,y from mx,my
  - rotate mx,my by -angle
- simplify hit tests using transformed mouse position
- simplify angle delta calculation
- update translate to use rotated delta drag to align coordinate frames of shape
  and mouse
- update scale to translate shape so opposite corner remains fixed
- on mouseup, commit shape delta, then clear shape delta
