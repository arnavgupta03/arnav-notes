* Basics of Control Systems
Control systems have:
- some reference/desired output
- a controller that provides an input into a system
- possibly some disturbance that influences the input
- a system that takes in input and produces some output
- a sensor that reads the output and feeds this to the controller
- some noise that influences the output read by the sensor

If the measured output is subtracted from the desired output, it is
negative feedback control.
