* What is AI?
*Artificial Intelligence*: the synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligently

The aspects that go into an agent acting intelligently include:
- what it does is appropriate for its circumstances, its goals, and its perceptual and computational
  limitations
- it takes into account the short-term and long-term consequences of its actions, including the effects
  on society and the environment
- it learns from experience
- it is flexible to changing environments and changing goals

Scientific goals of AI Research are:
- *analysis* of natural and artificial agents
- *testing hypotheses* about agent construction
- *building and experimenting* with agents

Engineering deals with designing and building useful intelligent artifacts.

*Machine Learning*: designing algorithms that learn from data

*Deep Learning*: machine learning with focus on neural networks

*Natural Language Processing/Computational Linguistics*: understanding/generating human language

*Computer Vision*: interpreting and generating visual information

*Robotics*: building robots that can act autonomously

*Cognitive Science*: understanding how humans/animals think, learn, and act
