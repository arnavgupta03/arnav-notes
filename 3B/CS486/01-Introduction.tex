\section{What is AI?}
\label{sec:org123e719}
\textbf{Artificial Intelligence}: the synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligently

The aspects that go into an agent acting intelligently include:
\begin{itemize}
\item what it does is appropriate for its circumstances, its goals, and its perceptual and computational
limitations
\item it takes into account the short-term and long-term consequences of its actions, including the effects
on society and the environment
\item it learns from experience
\item it is flexible to changing environments and changing goals
\end{itemize}

Scientific goals of AI Research are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{analysis} of natural and artificial agents
\item \textbf{testing hypotheses} about agent construction
\item \textbf{building and experimenting} with agents
\end{itemize}

Engineering deals with designing and building useful intelligent artifacts.

\textbf{Machine Learning}: designing algorithms that learn from data

\textbf{Deep Learning}: machine learning with focus on neural networks

\textbf{Natural Language Processing/Computational Linguistics}: understanding/generating human language

\textbf{Computer Vision}: interpreting and generating visual information

\textbf{Robotics}: building robots that can act autonomously

\textbf{Cognitive Science}: understanding how humans/animals think, learn, and act
